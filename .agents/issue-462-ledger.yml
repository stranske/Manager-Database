    title: Update the company number extraction function to include a fallback whole-document
      scan that does not rely on 'company'/'number' keywords on the same line.

    title: Enhance documentation and unit tests for two-digit year normalization in
      the parse() function. Define a clear policy where only years mapping to 20xx
      are accepted, and add tests for both acceptable and rejected cases.

    title: Replace the new .agents/issue-456-ledger.yml file by cleaning and updating
      the existing .agents/issue-129-ledger.yml to remove all 'todo' entries and ensure
      that it accurately reflects the current status of tasks without introducing
      additional files.

    title: Expand the adapter module's unit tests to cover all code paths, achieving
      at least 80% measured coverage using a tool like pytest-cov. Include tests for
      typical inputs, edge cases, and malformed inputs, and add a script or configuration
      file to generate a reproducible coverage report.

    title: Improve and add tests for the _iter_pdf_streams function and FlateDecode
      handling. Consider revising the regex to allow for variances in stream formatting
      and add test cases to simulate PDFs with alternative stream boundaries, multiple
      filters, and raw deflate edge cases.

    title: The company number detection logic identifies valid company numbers without
      requiring 'company' or 'number' keywords on the same line, using a fallback

    title: The parser normalizes two-digit years in filing dates by converting only
      values in the range 00-99 to 2000-2099, with all other two-digit years being
      rejected or explicitly handled according to the documented policy.
