### 🔨 How to import into GitHub

1. **Milestones** → New milestone for each row above (copy title & due date).  
2. **Issues** → Create template issues linked to each milestone (e.g. “Implement EDGAR adapter”, “Build Streamlit search page”).  
3. **Project Board** → Add columns for To-Do, In Progress, Done and drag issues under their milestone.

### 🤔 Next steps

- Make sure your repo has `docker-compose.yml`, `etl/`, `adapters/`, `README_bootstrap.md`.  
- Kick off **M1** by tagging **v0.1** once you’ve got the POC running.  
- Feel free to tweak deadlines if you hit unexpected SEC rate-limits or holiday weekends (e.g., July 4).

Let me know if you want issue templates or GitHub Action snippets to automate any of the above!
